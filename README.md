## Calculator

The program prints out a series of terminal queries where the
user needs to input certain values to function.

For the first question: "What function would you like to use?"
There are six valid options: addition, substraction, multiplication, division, percentage and sqrt. These will determine the calculation function used.

For all functions you will need two values, except for the sqrt function that only take in one value.
