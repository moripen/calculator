## Calculator

The program prints out a series of terminal queries where the
user needs to input certain values to function.

For the first question: "What function would you like to use?"
There are four valid options: addition, substraction, multiplication
and division. These will determine the calculation function used.

After that you input the first value and then the second and the 
sum will be printed out.
